# WeatherAppReact


This is my second attempt to weather app, this time with use of magnificent react.js. This attempt imho has much better styling and also just works better.
The guts of the app are based on simple asynchrous function that fetches desired info from api and creates new divs to contain this information. App is divided on two components, one of which is header/navbar, other one is main body. App is not finished yet, I will add error handling in the near future and also probably more functionality like choosing which attributes the user wants to see.
